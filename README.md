ðŸ“Œ Project Description: Chat Bot

This is a basic rule-based chatbot implemented in Python. The bot uses simple keyword detection to respond to user inputs. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to demonstrate how conditional logic and string matching can be used to simulate a conversational agent.

The chatbot starts a conversation in the terminal, greeting the user and asking for their name. It can respond to greetings, farewells, and simple questions such as how it's doing or the current time. If it doesn't understand a user's input, it replies with a default message indicating that it didn't quite catch that.

This project is ideal for Python beginners looking to learn about:

Basic input/output operations

Conditional logic (if/elif/else)

String handling

Simple while-loops and control flow
